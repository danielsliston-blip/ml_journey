# Day 01 — Setup Log

## What I built
- Created `ml-journey` repo
- Created first Colab notebook and saved to GitHub
- Built a mini dataset, saved/loaded CSV, plotted a chart

## What I learned
- Nothing at all
- Set up was quick and easy and did not take 90 minutes 

## What broke / friction
- Nothing did, just had to refresh when saving the file to GitHub 

## Next session (Day 2)
- Start Python basics exercises
- Build one tiny script and push it to GitHub
